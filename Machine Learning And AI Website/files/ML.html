        <h1>What is Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>
            Machine Learning is this concept that we can train computers to identify patterns in data,
            <br> and the use those patterns to predict off of new data.

        <h1>Why Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>
            Robots need body and brain
            <br> Learning behaviour is more successful than pre-programming it
            <br>Robots need to adjust to new situations to be sufficiently robust
            <br>Robots need to be able to explore their environment and learn during the exploration, and the use those patterns
            to predict off of new data.
            <br>
            <br>Many applications are too difficult to be hard coded
            <br>•Natural language processing
            <br>•Hand-character recognition
            <br>•Analysis of biological and medical data
            <br>•Web search
            <br>•Recommendation systems
            <br>•Prediction systems (weather forecast, forecast of power consumption)
            <br>•Often your customers do not want to give you their data -> provide them with tools that can adapt to their needs

            <h2>Machine learning – core tool for</h2>
            Extracting knowledge from data (Knowledge Engineering!)
            <br>Allowing machines to make decisions
            <br>Allowing machines to make predictions
            <br>Allowing machines to adapt to new situations.
            <br>Allowing machines to improve their capabilities and outperform their teachers
            <br>(Lazy software engineers)
